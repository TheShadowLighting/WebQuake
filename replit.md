# WebQuake - Replit Project

## Overview
WebQuake is an HTML5 WebGL port of the classic Quake game by id Software. This project includes both a web client that runs in browsers and a Node.js dedicated server for multiplayer functionality.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: HTML5/WebGL client located in `Client/` directory
- **Server**: Node.js dedicated game server in `Server/` directory  
- **HTTP Server**: Custom Node.js server (`webquake-server.js`) serves frontend on port 5000
- **Game Server**: Dedicated Quake server runs on port 26000 for multiplayer

## Current State
✅ **Successfully Imported and Configured**
- Node.js environment set up with required dependencies
- HTTP server configured to serve WebQuake client on port 5000
- Proper MIME types and cache control headers configured
- Deployment configuration set for production (autoscale)
- Game server configured to run on port 26000 (separate from frontend)

## Setup Details
- Frontend accessible at: `http://localhost:5000`
- Game server (multiplayer): port 26000
- HTTP server includes range request support for better compatibility
- CORS enabled and caching disabled for development

## Usage Notes
- To fully run the game, users need to provide Quake data files (id1 folder)
- The shareware version with first episode is sufficient for basic testing
- Multiplayer requires running the dedicated server: `cd Server && node WebQDS.js`
- Web client connects to multiplayer via WebSocket on port 26000

## Deployment
- Configured for Replit autoscale deployment
- Production command: `node webquake-server.js`
- Serves static files with proper HTTP headers and range support
